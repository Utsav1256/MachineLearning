# Python Basics:
## What are Variables?
`Variables` are anything that can store some value in them and are subject to be changed.

- In Other languages like in `Java` and `C++`, we declare `datatype` of the variable (like int, double, char, String, ...).
```java
 int a = 10;
```

- But, in `Python` we don't declare the datatype of the variable while initializing them.
```py
 a = 10;
```

- We simply write variable's name and assign it value.

```
 Python is a `Dynamically typed` language.
```
- This means that we don't need to declare the datatype of the variable while initializing them.

- Python will automatically detect the datatype of the variable and assign it to the variable.

- There is no semicolon to be used to end lines unlike in Java, C or C++.

- To check the datatype of variables, simply write

```py
 type(variable_name), 
```
 - it will output the datatype of the variable.
 ```py
 a = 10;
 print(type(a)); # -> <class 'int'>

 # What is `class` here? -> we will see later on.
```
